Compose and run task graphs. In part, this is a study in type-checking.

## Results
### `type` can be preferable to `interface`
Consider a graph parameterized by a manifest of the nodes it can contain:

```typescript
interface BasicNodeManifest {
  [nodeId: string]: Task<anyInput, anyOutput>;
}

class Graph<M extends BasicNodeManifest> {
  addNode<K extends keyof M>(nodeId: K, node: M[K]) {...}
}
```

A graph parameterized with the `BasicNodeManifest` will accept nodes with any (string) ID, as the type argument does not constrain `keyof M`.

If we wanted to constrain the acceptable node IDs, we might try writing a manifest like

```typescript
interface StricterManifest extends BasicNodeManifest {
  onlyThisNode: Task<SomeFoo, SomeBar>;
  andThatNode: Task<SomeBaz, SomeQuux>;
}
```

Unfortunately, `StricterManifest` would not actually constrain our valid node IDs, since it inherits the index signature from `BasicNodeManifest`. Moreover, we couldn't remove the supertype, because then TypeScript would complain that `StricterManifest` is missing an index signature.

We have a nifty escape hatch, however: currently, TypeScript exempts type aliases from the need to declare index signatures in this scenario ([*cf.* this issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/15300)):

```typescript
type StrictestManifest = {
  onlyThisNode: Task<SomeFoo, SomeBar>;
  andThatNode: Task<SomeBaz, SomeQuux>;
}
const g: Graph<StrictestManifest> = new Graph() // `g` only wants specific node IDs!
g.addNode('SomeRandomNode', node) // Error: Argument of type '"SomeRandomNode"' is not assignable...
```

Of course, in the event of a graph whose nodes will only be known at runtime, we can fall back to the `BasicNodeManifest` without losing our ability to compile code.

```typescript
const g = new Graph()
g.addNode('SomeRandomNode', node)
```
